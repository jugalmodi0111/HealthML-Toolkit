    "# HealthML-Toolkit: Healthcare Chatbot Module\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook implements an **NLTK-based conversational AI** for healthcare queries, symptom analysis, and appointment scheduling. It's one of three core modules in the HealthML-Toolkit system.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What It Does\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Pattern-Matching Conversations**: Uses regex-based patterns to understand user queries about symptoms, appointments, and health advice\n",
    "2. **Intent Detection**: Identifies emergency situations, appointment requests, and general health inquiries\n",
    "3. **Conversation Persistence**: Automatically saves conversations to binary files with timestamps\n",
    "4. **PDF Export**: Generate professional appointment summaries and chat history reports\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Features\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Emergency Detection**: Recognizes serious symptoms (chest pain, severe bleeding) and escalates appropriately\n",
    "- **Personalized Responses**: Uses capture groups and pronoun transformations for natural conversations\n",
    "- **Appointment Tracking**: Records appointment requests with timestamps for follow-up\n",
    "- **Extensible Pattern Library**: Easy to add new medical patterns and responses\n",
    "\n",
    "### Architecture\n",
    "\n",

    "Optional PDF Export\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Usage\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Run this notebook**: Execute cells sequentially\n",
    "2. **CLI mode**: `python main.py chatbot` from the project root\n",
    "3. **Integrate**: Import functions in other Python scripts\n",
    "\n",
    "### Outputs\n",
    "\n",
    "- `saved_conversations/appointments_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.bin` - Binary conversation logs\n",
    "- `saved_conversations/appointments_summary.pdf` - PDF reports (optional)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Related Modules\n",
